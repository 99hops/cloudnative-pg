Version 0.1.0 -  3 Apr 2020

- Reuse of existing persistent storage with Pods (required for rolling updates)
- Independence between operator container image and PostgreSQL container image
  (required by rolling updates) - this enables usage of Community PostgreSQL images
- Rolling updates for the update of the operator and the entire cluster
  to a new version of PostgreSQL, by updating all the replicas first;
  switchover can be entirely managed by Kubernetes once replicas have been
  updated (`switchover` option), or manually triggered by the user (`wait` option)
- Check framework for update-in-progress of a Pod
- Improvements in cluster status information
- E2E tests for Kubernetes 1.18
- E2E performance tests for failover (< 5 seconds)
- Improvements in E2E tests for switchover
- Support for PostgreSQL's `cluster_name` GUC
- New documentation section `Exposing Postgres services`
- New documentation section `Security`

Version 0.0.1 -  5 Mar 2020

Prototype of PostgreSQL Operator with:

* PostgreSQL 12.2 container image

    * automated recreation of a replica
* Planned switchover of the primary instance, by promoting a selected replica
* Scale up/down capabilities
* Definition of an arbitrary number of instances (minimum 1 - one primary server)
* Definition of the *read-write* service, to connect your applications to the only primary server of the cluster
* Definition of the *read-only* service, to connect your applications to any of the instances for read workloads
* Support for Local Persistent Volumes with PVC templates
