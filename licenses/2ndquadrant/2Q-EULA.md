This End User License Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of the date of the
applicable Statement of Work ("Effective Date") by and between **2nd Quadrant
Limited**, a United Kingdom registered company ("2Q") and the company which
downloads the Software (the "Company" and, together with 2Q, the "parties"),
and includes the following Terms and Conditions.

That 2Q software listed in the applicable Statement of Work (defined below).


# Support

As per Statement of Work.


# Term

In the case of production use of the Software, coterminous with Production
Support subscription purchased as part of underlying documents binding 2Q and
Company to the provision and payment for support for the Software   (each a
"Statement of Work" or "SOW") In the case of a trial license, the Term will be
limited to thirty calendar days.


# Fees, Payment Terms

As per applicable Statement of Work.


# Terms and Conditions

This Agreement is made and entered into by and between 2Q and Company, and sets
forth the terms under which Company may use certain 2Q software and/or receive
certain consulting services under Orders governed by this Agreement. If Company
does not agree to the terms of this Agreement it may not download or otherwise
access the Software.

This Agreement cannot be changed without a mutually signed amendment. 2Q will
not in any way change the terms of this Agreement. Any SOW placed under this
version of the Agreement may only be modified by a mutually signed amendment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company and 2Q have entered into a separate
License Agreement signed by both parties for the same software, then that
License Agreement, and not this Agreement shall govern the same.

1.  **Software License.** 2Q has developed and licenses the
    software specified on the underlying Statement of Work ("Software")
    for use by Company on its own and for use with Company's own
    software. While such use may include Company's use on Company
    controlled servers for applications that are client facing, it
    expressly excludes any deployment on non-Company controlled servers
    or other distribution to any third party. In the case of a trial
    license, the Software will be limited to non-production use. Upon
    2Q's receipt of all of the fees specified on the underlying
    Statement of Work for the support services and licensing
    (collectively the "Fees"), 2Q grants to Company a limited,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free, paid-up,
    non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software for
    the duration of the Term of the support services stated on the
    applicable Statement of Work, subject to the additional restrictions
    and permissions in this Agreement ("Software License"). For clarity,
    some of the Software, including scripts, is provided in source code
    formats, but Company may not modify any Software in any format. This
    Agreement does not apply to any open source software or other third
    party software. All Fees are non-refundable. Any changes to this
    Agreement, including changes in Software licensed by 2Q to Company
    must be stated in the applicable Statement of Work or other written
    document, and signed by both parties. Particular terms not defined
    in this Agreement may be defined in the Statement of Work.

2.  **Term.** Each Software License begins on the date agreed to by the
    parties, and continues for the duration of the "Term" stated above.
    Company may renew the Software License for an additional Term as
    agreed to by the parties by paying the Fees set forth in the
    applicable Statement of Work and/or any extensions thereto prior to
    the end of the current Term. If 2Q does not receive renewal Fees set
    forth in the applicable Statement of Work or any extension thereto
    by the end of a current Term, then the Software License shall
    automatically terminate, and Company is required to delete all
    copies of the Software in Company's possession or control within one
    month of the end of the Term. 2Q may terminate a Software License on
    no fewer than thirty days' prior written notice to Company, except
    that this Software License will expire coterminous with the
    underlying Support subscription in the underlying SOW. Each license
    will expire unless renewed pursuant to a Statement of Work, or
    extension thereto effective at the end of the current Term.

3.  **Restrictions.** An "instance" is defined as a PostgreSQL,
    2ndQPostgres, or Postgres-BDR server process running on a pair
    Internet protocol ("IP") address and transmission control protocol
    ("TCP") port (usually port 5432). Company may only use the Software
    as provided herein. Further Company shall not disclose or use the
    Software (a) outside of Company for any purpose; or (b) for
    technical evaluation from any third party; or (c) for creating a
    product that competes with the Software or any other 2Q product; or
    (d) for resale of any kind. Company may not permit any affiliate or
    subsidiary of the Company (each, an "Affiliate") to access or use
    the Software, unless the Affiliate is listed in the applicable SOW,
    in which case Company will be responsible for the actions and
    omissions of each Affiliate. As noted in the Support provisions, all
    production instances of the Software are also required to be under a
    2Q Support subscription; otherwise the Software License for the same
    automatically expires. All rights not expressly granted to Company
    are reserved by 2Q.

4.  **Support.** 2Q will provide support and maintenance
    services for the Software during the Term ("Support") set forth in
    the applicable Statement of Work.

5.  **Proprietary Rights.** 2Q and its licensors retain all rights,
    including copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual
    property rights (collectively, "Proprietary Rights") in the Software
    and in all other 2Q goods and services, including without
    limitation, all derivative works, improvements, modifications,
    extensions, enhancements, customizations, and the like (collectively
    "Future Works"), regardless of whether performed under any
    agreement, including without limitation, any master agreement
    between 2Q and Company purporting to grant any Proprietary rights to
    Company. The foregoing applies regardless of the author of such
    Future Works. Company and its licensors retain any and all
    Proprietary Rights in and to Company's computer programs and other
    goods and services and Future Works, subject to 2Q's and its
    licensors' Proprietary Rights in the Software licensed pursuant to
    this Agreement. Company may not remove any product identification or
    Proprietary Rights notices from the Software.

6.  **Confidentiality.** Except as expressly set forth herein, 2Q and
    Company shall maintain in confidence the terms of this Agreement.
    Each party ("Discloser") may disclose to the other party
    ("Recipient") proprietary or confidential information
    ("Confidential Information"). "Confidential Information" includes
    any information, communication or data, in any form, including, but
    not limited to oral, written, or electronic, which the Discloser
    desires to protect against unrestricted disclosure or use, including
    without limitation, 2Q's Software and Proprietary Rights, Company's
    customer information, each party's business information, any
    personally-identifiable information, financial data, marketing data,
    and any other information that a reasonable business person would
    expect to keep confidential. Confidential Information does not need
    to be marked as such. All Confidential Information shall remain the
    sole property of the Discloser and its confidentiality shall be
    maintained and protected by the Recipient with the same degree of
    care as the Recipient uses for its own confidential and proprietary
    information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.
    The Recipient shall not disclose the Discloser's Confidential
    Information to any third party or use it other than for purposes of
    this Agreement. The restrictions on the use or disclosure of any
    Confidential Information shall not apply to any information:
    (i) that is or becomes generally available to the public without
    breach of this Agreement by the Recipient; (ii) is rightfully in the
    Recipient's possession (without a duty of confidentiality) prior to
    disclosure to it by the Discloser; or (iii) is independently
    developed by the Recipient. If a Recipient is required by applicable
    laws or regulations to disclose the Discloser's Confidential
    Information, then unless prohibited by applicable laws or
    regulations the Recipient will provide the Discloser prompt written
    notice and will cooperate with the Discloser's efforts to limit the
    required disclosure.

7.  **Data.** 2Q may collect and use technical information regarding how
    Company uses the Software and how 2Q provides Support to Company
    ("Non-Personal Data"). Generally speaking, 2Q collects
    personally-identifiable information ("Personal Data") only when
    necessary to establish contact with Company's staff for Support and
    management of this Agreement. All Personal Data will be collected,
    processed, stored, shared, used and protected as stated in 2Q's
    current privacy statement, as amended by 2Q from time to time.

8.  **Export Control.** Company represents, warrants and covenants that it
    has complied with, and will continue to comply with, all applicable
    laws, regulations and government-issued legally binding rules and
    guidance of the United Kingdom, United States and/or any foreign
    countries with respect to the exportation or importation and/or use
    of the 2Q Software, any modifications, enhancements, Future Works,
    and updates thereto, and any technical data derived therefrom,
    outside of the United Kingdom, United States or into the United
    Kingdom, United States or into another country, including, but not
    limited to obtaining any necessary consents and requesting or filing
    any documents as required by the applicable governing body.

9.  **Government Clauses.** If Company is the United States Government or
    any contractor thereof, all licenses granted hereunder are subject
    to the following:

    1.  for acquisition by or on behalf of civil agencies, as necessary
        to obtain protection as "commercial computer software" and
        related documentation in accordance with the terms of this
        Agreement and as specified in Subpart 12.1212 of the Federal
        Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its
        successors; and
    2.  for acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense
        (DOD) and any agencies or units thereof, as necessary to obtain
        protection as "commercial computer software" and related
        documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
        as specified in Subparts 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the DOD
        FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, and its
        successors, manufacturer is 2nd Quadrant Limited.

10. **Indemnity.** Each party ("Indemnitor") shall indemnify, defend and
    hold harmless the other party ("Indemnitee") from and against any
    and all claims, and suits, damages, costs and expenses (including,
    without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in
    connection with any action, suit, proceeding or claim (each, a
    "Claim"), brought by an unrelated third party against the Indemnitee
    that alleges that (x) in the case 2Q, 2Q's Software as delivered to
    the Company infringes any intellectual property or other rights of a
    third party or violates any applicable law or regulation and (y) in
    the case of Company, any Company use of the Software, beyond the
    license grant provided herein infringes any intellectual property or
    other rights of a third party or violates any applicable law or
    regulation. For any Claim, the Indemnitee will provide prompt
    written notice to the Indemnitor and provide reasonable assistance
    to the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor will promptly assume the defense
    of any valid Claim with Indemnitor's counsel, and shall have the
    right to settle or defend the Claim at Indemnitor's sole expense.
    However, Indemnitor shall not have the right to admit or assess
    liability against any Indemnitee.

11. **Disclaimers.** 2Q AND ITS LICENSORS EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, AND SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON
    INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT FOR OBLIGATIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND
    INDEMNIFICATION, AND EXCEPT FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION
    OF 2Q'S OR ITS LICENSORS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR COMPANY
    EXCEEDING THE LICENSE GRANT HEREUNDER AND/OR SECTION 3
    (RESTRICTIONS), TO THE EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    EITHER PARTY (OR 2Q'S LICENSORS) BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR (A) ANY
    AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE TOTAL FEES RECEIVED BY 2Q FROM COMPANY
    PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE UNDERLYING SOW; (B) ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS
    REASONABLE CONTROL; OR (C) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, RELIANCE,
    CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR
    SAVINGS), IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ANY CLAIM OR ACTION
    (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE),
    EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBLE EXISTENCE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY
    NOT APPLY.
    2Q ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR CUSTOMER DATA.

12. **Termination for Material Breach.** If a party materially breaches this
    Agreement, the non-breaching party will notify the breaching party
    in writing, and the breaching party shall have thirty days to fully
    cure the material breach; otherwise this Agreement will terminate at
    the end of the thirty-day period. Either party may terminate this
    Agreement immediately upon written notice if a receiver, trustee in
    bankruptcy or similar officer is appointed to take charge of any or
    all of the other party's property, or dissolves, liquidates or
    otherwise fails to operate in the ordinary course. Those provisions
    of this Agreement that expressly state they survive termination of
    this Agreement, or that are necessary to construe the Agreement or
    adjudicate rights under this Agreement shall survive any termination
    of this Agreement.

13. **Governing Law.** This Agreement and performance hereunder shall be
    governed by the laws of England and Wales without regard to
    conflicts of laws provisions or principles. To the extent it does
    not diminish either party's insurance coverage and/or response to
    any claim, any and all disputes between the parties shall be
    determined by one arbitrator in binding arbitration administered by
    the International Centre for Dispute Resolution pursuant to its
    International Arbitration Rules.

14. **Hearings.** Subject to Section 12, to the extent allowable in any
    arbitration, all hearings will be conducted by audio conference and
    video conference in the English language.
    The arbitrator's award will be final, binding on the parties and
    non-appealable. Judgment on the award may be entered and enforced in
    any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction. Any award of
    damages shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this
    Agreement. No dispute will relieve Company from its obligation of
    paying the undisputed portion of any Fees payable hereunder.
15. **Waiver.** Unless waived and agreed in writing by the
    parties, no action or inaction by a party under this Agreement will
    constitute a waiver of a party's rights or obligations under this
    Agreement.
16. **Entire Agreement, Severability, Assignment**. This Agreement
    (including any SOW, addendum or amendment to this Agreement) is the
    entire agreement between Company and 2Q relating to the Software and
    the support services (if any) and supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and
    representations with respect to the Software or any other subject
    matter covered by this Agreement. Company's use and acceptance of
    the Software is expressly limited to the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement and any purchase orders that have been signed by an
    authorized representative of both parties. Any additional or
    different terms or conditions in any communication by Company are
    hereby rejected and shall be null and void, irrespective of the
    means of Company's acceptance. Any failure by 2Q to object to any
    additional or different provisions proposed by Company shall not
    constitute a waiver of these terms and conditions, nor constitute
    acceptance of any such Company's terms and conditions. This
    Agreement shall be applicable whether or not it is attached to or
    enclosed with the Software. Company may cancel submitted purchase
    orders or SOWs (if any) only with the prior written consent of 2Q.
    This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by both
    parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void,
    invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, such provision
    shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable and the other provisions shall continue in full force
    and effect. The failure of 2Q to act with respect to a breach of
    this Agreement by Company or others does not constitute a waiver and
    shall not limit 2Q's rights with respect to such breach or any
    subsequent breaches. This Agreement is personal to Company and may
    not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever, directly
    or indirectly, without 2Q's consent and any action or conduct in
    violation of the foregoing shall be void and without effect. 2Q
    expressly reserves the right to assign this Agreement and to
    delegate any of its obligations hereunder. If the terms of this
    Agreement conflict with any other agreement between the parties,
    this Agreement will prevail.
